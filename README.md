# Swift Notes App

## Description
I have developed a Simple Notes Web App using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and localStorage. This web app provides a convenient and user-friendly way to create, save, and search notes effortlessly.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The webpage has a simple and intuitive layout, allowing users to quickly grasp its functionality. The clean design ensures a seamless note-taking experience.

- **Add and Delete Notes:** Users can easily add new notes by typing text in the input field and clicking the "Add Note" button. Each note is saved to the browser's localStorage, allowing for persistent storage and retrieval. Additionally, every note displayed on the page includes a delete button, enabling users to remove unwanted notes effortlessly.

- **Efficient Note Search:** The app offers a search function that allows users to find specific notes quickly. By typing keywords in the search bar, the app filters the notes in real-time, displaying only the relevant ones. This feature makes it convenient for users to locate specific information within their notes.

- **LocalStorage Integration:** The utilization of localStorage ensures that the notes persist even after closing and reopening the webpage. Users can confidently rely on the app to securely store their important thoughts, reminders, and ideas.
